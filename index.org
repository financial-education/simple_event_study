Here we are going to cover how to test for a differential effect of one event on two assets. As an example, our event will be the results of the 2020 Presidential election, and our assets will be oil (XLE) and tech (XLK) ETFs.  Our null hypothesis is:

#+begin_example
There is no difference in the reactions of XLE anf XLF to the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election.
#+end_example

If we are able to reject the null then we have found evidence in favor of a different reaction.
